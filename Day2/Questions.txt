1. When we type in the interpreter the following:
>>> 10(b)
We get a NameError that b is not defined. However, try:
>>> 10(4)
Now, we get the error message that int is not callable. Why didn't it give the same error in the first case above?

2. How does 3 + 4 + 5 reduce to function call?

3. How does 3 + 4 * 5 reduce to function call?

4. What is the output of the following:
>>> a = [10,20] 
>>> b = [a,a] 
>>> b[1][1] = b 
>>> print(b[0][1][0][0])
>>> print(b)

5. What is the output of the following?
>>> sep = "Python"
>>> print("Hello", "World", "Programming")

6. What is the output of the following?
>>> print("Hello", "World", "Programming", sep="Python")
>>> print(sep)

7. What is the output of the following?
>>> sep = "Python"
>>> print("Hello", "World", "Programming")
>>> print(sep)
What can you infer from all the above (questions 5-7)?

8. What is the output of the following (assume it is written in a file, and not interpreter)
exec(print("a=10"))
print(a)
