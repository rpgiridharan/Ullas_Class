A prime number is one that has no other divisor
Than one and itself, you can't put it any nicer;
But the interesting properties of these primes
Reflect somewhat the friendships of our times.

If we look at these numbers' distribution,
They seem to defy all our intuition;
We have four prime numbers less than ten
But they grow sparse for larger values of n.

In the beginning, so many you will find,
As you proceed, your chagrin grows refined
To see that it takes you a longer stretch of time
To determine whether the number is or not a prime.

Think of the mellow days of your childhood
You would say indeed those days were very good
Those were days when you easily made a new friend
Your happiness seemed like it would never end.

So you would feel when primes you start enumerating,
The feeling that you get is truly exhilarating;
So easy it appears to generate the next one -
You do not realize you have only just begun.

As the years of your childhood pass, you realize
That not all people are friendly, nor very nice;
It takes you a little more effort than before
To make a new friend you can trust to the core.

And as you proceed deeper in the number list,
So also you go through life's hazy mist;
To determine whether a number is prime at this stage
Is like finding a close friend as you grow in age.

As we proceed through life's number line
Like primes, our friends are scattered fine
But though there appears to be no true friend in sight,
Remember, the list of prime numbers is truly infinite!
