Find the presence of vowels in all possible substrings of the given string (string contains both lowercase and uppercase letters). For each given string you have to print the total number of vowels.
Example: string is "baceb" so the substrings will be like -"b, ba, bac, bace, a, ac, ace, aceb, c, ce, ceb, e, eb, baceb" now the number of vowels in each substring will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 2, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2  and the total number will be sum of all presence which is 16.
