1. What is the output of the following? Explain why.
>>> print = 10
>>> del print
>>> print("Hello")

2. What is the output of the following, given input as 1? Why?
n = int(input())
def foo():
	print("Hello")
	if n > 10:
		def bar():
			print("Greater than 10")
	else:
		def foo():
			print("Less than 10")
	foo()
	del foo
	foo()
foo()

3. What is the output?
>>> i = 10
>>> for i in range(5):
>>>	pass
>>> print(i)

4. What is the output?
>>> i = 10
>>> x = [i*i for i in range(5)]
>>> print(i)

5. What is the output?
>>> def f(x,y):
>>>	print(x,y)
>>> f(print("Hello"), f(print("I get printed first"), print("I am last")))

6. This is a challenging exercise. Write a function that takes another function as argument, and checks if this function when run will give an UnboundLocalError (obviously, without running it).
