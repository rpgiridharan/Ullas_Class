# THERRE ARE NOOOOOOOOOOO POINTERS IN PYTHON!!!!!!*
# Karatsuba's algo: used internally to do fast multiplication (this is internally coded in C)


# Guido van Rossum - inventor of Python. Was a Dutch mathematician
#scripting language:
#	there is no declaration of type of variables
#	if it is 'short'
# www.python.org
# We will use Python 3.X
# NOT USE Python 2.X (because there are some bugs here)
# write code from column 1: top-level
# uses compiler first to check only for syntax errors
# if even one syntax error, it will not run
# else: it runs the program now using an interpreter
# Python becomes much slower than C!
# if you write a progrm in a file, you can run it by:
#	python filename
# else: run interactively
# expr: always has a value!
# in python interactive mode, value of an expr is always "echoed"
# so you don't have to say print(expr), but can just say expr in interactive mode.

# stmt: something that is executable on a line by itself
#



print("Hello World")
print(10)
#print("Python)
print("C")

2 + 3	#Value not displayed, because values of expressions are not output unless we say print
#But if we run this same in interactive mode, you will see it echoes the output.
