1. What is the output?
def f(a, b=a):
	print(a,b)
a = 5
f(20)

2. What is the output?
y = (lambda x: x = 10)
x = 20
y(x)
print(x)

3. What is the output?
a = []
for i in range(5):
	a.append(lambda : i*i)
print(a[2]())
Is there a way to fix the above?

4. What is the output?
a = [10, 20, 30, 40]
b = [100, 200, 300, 400]
x, y = zip(*zip(a, b))
print(x, y)

5. Can you write a lambda function that takes a parameter n, and computes the factorial of n?

6. What is the output?
def f(x, a=[lambda y=print("Hello"):y]): 
	a.append(x) 
	print(len(a)) 
f(10, [20])  
f(100)
f(3, [4])
f(200)

7. What is the output?
def f(a, b, *c, d, *e):
	print(a,b,c,d,e)
f(10,20,30,40,50,d=60)

8. Deduce the possible header of the definition of function f from the following information about its calls.  â€‹
- f(1,2) gives error 
- f(a=1, b=2, d=3, e=4) is valid 
- f(1,2,d=3,e=4) is valid 
- f(1,2,3,4,e=5,g=10,d=2) is valid 
- f(1,2,3,4,e=5,g=10) gives error 
- f(1,2,3,4) gives error 
- f(1,2,3,4,5,6) gives error

9. Assume you are given a file where each line of the file contains an integer. Call this file, "file.txt". What should the following line in Python do?:
print(*sorted(open("file.txt"), key=int), file=open("file2.txt", "w"), sep="")
- What happens if we remove 'key=int' from the above line?
- What happens if we remove * before sorted in the above line?
- What happens if we remove sep="" in the above line?
- What happens if we replace key=int with the following: key=lambda x:int(x[-1])

10. Write a lambda function that takes a parameter x (which is a list), and mutates the list by modifying its zeroth element to become 200.

11. Write a function that takes any number of parameters, and returns the sum of all the parameters. Can you write this function as a lambda? Do not use inbuilt sum function for this.

12. What is the output of the following?
>>> (lambda x: lambda y: x(y)[2:])(bin)(10)

13. Given the output of ls -l command, which lists out various fields for each file, print out that file which has the biggest size. A challenge would be to programmatically get the output of ls -l as well!

14. Display the output of ls -l command, sorted according to file size.
